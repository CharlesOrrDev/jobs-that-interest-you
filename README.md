## Peer Review: Bugs I found

- Light mode is pretty bad. May want to take it into account
- Make sure to at least to change the name of the document, so it isn't the default "Create Next App"
- Make sure to add &apos; so that "What Id Like To Achieve" -> "What I'd Like To Achieve"

- Love the load screen. gonna see how you did that later
